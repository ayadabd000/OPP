# OPP
Six algorithms for Optimal PMU Placement (OPP) problem, including two Simulated Annealing methods, two Graph Theoretic Procedures, and Recursive Security N Algorithm.

The five _casexx.m_ files are the data of IEEE 14-,30-,57- and 118-bus systems and New England 39-bus system obtained from MatPower.

You can run test using the above systems through _main.m_ or _auto\_test.m_.

A detailed report about OPP problem and the six algorithms are in the project report file.
